    "# Variables\n",
    "### Definition and Analogy\n",
    "\n",
    "- A variable in Python is like a container that holds data, similar to how containers in a kitchen store rice, sugar, or water.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Variables act as named storage locations in the computer's memory (RAM).\n",
    "\n",
    "### How Variables Work\n",
    "\n",
    "- When you assign a value to a variable (e.g., a = 1), Python stores the value in memory and associates it with the variable name.\n",
    "\n",
    "- You can change the value stored in a variable at any time, just like you can change whatâ€™s inside a container."

    "# Data Types\n",
    "### What are Data Types?\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data types specify what kind of value a variable can hold (e.g., number, text, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are necessary to perform operations correctly and avoid errors (e.g., you cannot add a number and a string directly).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why Data Types Matter\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data types help the computer understand how to store and operate on data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example, adding two numbers is valid, but adding a number and a string will cause an error.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Built-in Data Types in Python\n",
    "### 1. Numbers\n",
    "- **Integer (int):** Whole numbers (e.g., a = 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Float (float):** Decimal numbers (e.g., a = 1.1)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Complex (complex):** Numbers with a real and imaginary part (e.g., a = 8 + 2j)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. String (str)\n",
    "- Text data enclosed in quotes (e.g., \"Hello World\", \"Python Programming\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Boolean (bool)\n",
    "- Represents True or False values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Useful for logical operations and conditions (e.g., can be used to indicate if someone can drive or not).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Sequence Types\n",
    "- **List (list):** Ordered collection of items, can hold different data types, and is mutable (can be changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: my_list = [1, \"Hello\", 3.14]\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Tuple (tuple):** Ordered collection of items, immutable (cannot be changed).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: my_tuple = (1, \"Hello\", 3.14)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Dictionary (dict)\n",
    "- Stores data as key-value pairs, similar to a real-world dictionary where you look up a word (key) to find its meaning (value).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example: student = {\"name\": \"Sakshi\", \"marks\": 28, \"can_vote\": True}"
