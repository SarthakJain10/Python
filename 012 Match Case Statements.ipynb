    "## What is the Match Statement?\n",
    "- The match statement is Python’s way of enabling pattern matching, introduced in Python 3.10.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It provides a cleaner alternative to long chains of if-elif-else statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The syntax and logic are inspired by switch-case statements in other programming languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Key Point:\n",
    "- You must use Python 3.10 or later to utilize the match statement. Attempting to use it in earlier versions (e.g., Python 3.8) will result in errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Comparison with Switch Statements\n",
    "- In C++, Java, and similar languages, the switch statement allows you to execute code based on the value of a variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python’s match statement serves a similar purpose but is more powerful, supporting complex patterns and data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike C++/Java, Python does not require a break statement after each case; only the first matching case is executed, and the rest are ignored.\n",

    "## Key Concepts and Features\n",
    "### 1. Default Case with Underscore (_):\n",
    "\n",
    "- The underscore _ acts as a catch-all or default case, similar to else in if-else chains or default in switch-case statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. No Need for Break Statements:\n",
    "\n",
    "- In C++/Java, you must use break to prevent fall-through to the next case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Python, only the first matching case is executed—no need for break.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Pattern Matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The match statement can compare variables to various patterns, not just simple values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This allows for advanced matching, such as destructuring sequences or matching data types (not covered in detail in this lecture).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Practical Example (Voting System):\n",
    "\n",
    "- Imagine a voting system where a user can select one of four options.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The match statement can be used to execute different actions based on the selected option, making the code more readable and organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Important Notes\n",
    "- Always ensure your Python environment is version 3.10 or higher to use the match statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are using tools like VS Code, ensure your interpreter is set to Python 3.10+.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If you are coming from another language, remember:\n",
    "\n",
    "- No break statements are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Only the matched case runs; others are ignored.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "- The match statement is a modern feature in Python (3.10+) for cleaner and more powerful conditional logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It replaces lengthy if-elif-else chains and is similar to switch-case in other languages, but with more features and no need for break statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Use the underscore _ for the default case.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always check your Python version before using match statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This feature enhances code readability and maintainability, especially for complex conditional logic."
