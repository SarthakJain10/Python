    "### Definition:\n",
    "Recursion is the process of defining a function (or problem) in terms of itself. In programming, a recursive function is one that calls itself within its own body.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursion is not exclusive to Python; it is a general programming concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It is especially useful for problems that can be divided into similar subproblems, such as mathematical computations (factorials, Fibonacci series, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Every recursive function must have a base case to prevent infinite recursion."

    "# How Does Recursion Work?\n",
    "### Function Calls Within Functions\n",
    "- Functions can call other functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Recursion occurs when a function calls itself, typically with a different argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example:\n",
    "If you have a function to calculate the average, you can call a sum function inside it. But in recursion, you call the same function within itself, usually with a modified argument (e.g., n-1)."
