    "# Important Notes and Best Practices\n",
    "- ### Use Quotes for Strings:\n",
    "Always use double or single quotes for string outputs in shorthand if-else.\n",
    "For example, print(\"B\") will print the letter B, but print(B) (without quotes) will look for a variable named B and cause a syntax error if it doesn't exist.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Not for Complex Logic:\n",
    "Shorthand if-else is not suitable for situations where you need to execute multiple statements or more complex logic. In such cases, use the standard multi-line if-else for better readability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Readability Matters:\n",
    "Overusing shorthand if-else, especially for long or nested conditions, can make code hard to read and maintain.\n",
    "Good code should be understandable by others, not just the original author.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### Code Maintainability:\n",
    "The most important aspect of writing code is maintainability. Code should be clear enough that even years later, you (or someone else) can understand why and how it was written.\n",
    "\n",
    "- ### General Principle:\n",
    "Genius programmers write code for others to understand, not just themselves. This principle holds true in all programming languages."
