    "# What is Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "- **Definition:** OOP is a programming approach that organizes code by mapping real-world entities into objects, allowing for better structure, maintainability, and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Contrast with Procedural Programming:** Traditional procedural programming relies on functions and variables, often leading to code that is harder to manage as complexity grows. OOP, in contrast, groups related data and behaviors into objects, making code easier to understand and modify.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Use Object-Oriented Programming?\n",
    "- **Organization:** OOP helps organize code by grouping related properties and behaviors into classes and objects.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Maintainability:** Programs become more manageable, especially as they scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Real-World Mapping:** OOP allows programmers to model real-world entities directly, making programs more intuitive.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Reusability:** Code can be reused through inheritance and polymorphism, reducing duplication.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Concepts of OOP\n",
    "### 1. Classes and Objects\n",
    "- **Class:** A blueprint or template for creating objects. It defines the properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that its objects will have.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example: A Businessman class can have attributes like sales, profit, and ad_spend.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Object:** An instance of a class, containing its own data and able to perform actions defined by the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example: rajeev = Businessman() creates an object rajeev with its own sales and profit data."

    "### 2. Encapsulation\n",
    "- **Definition:** Encapsulation is the concept of bundling data (attributes) and methods (functions) that operate on the data into a single unit (class). It also restricts direct access to some of an object's components, which is known as data hiding.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefit:** Protects the internal state of an object and only allows modification through well-defined methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example: Changing a name using shubham.changeName(\"Shubhi\") instead of directly accessing the data."

    "### 3. Inheritance\n",
    "- **Definition:** Inheritance allows a class (child or derived class) to inherit properties and methods from another class (parent or base class).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefit:** Promotes code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Example: A VIPRailwayForm class can inherit from a basic RailwayForm class and add extra features like meal preferences."

    "### 4. Polymorphism\n",
    "- **Definition:** Polymorphism means \"many forms.\" It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. Methods can be overridden to perform different tasks based on the object calling them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefit:** Increases flexibility and integration of code.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Examples and Analogies\n",
    "### Procedural Programming Example\n",
    "- Variables for each businessman: sales1, profit1, ad1, etc.\n",
