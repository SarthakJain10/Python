    "# What Are Magic/Dunder Methods?\n",
    "- **Magic methods** are special methods predefined by Python with double underscore prefixes and suffixes (e.g., \\_\\_init\\_\\_, \\_\\_len\\_\\_, \\_\\_str\\_\\_).\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Purpose:** To perform special tasks automatically when certain actions are performed on objects, like initialization, representation, length calculation, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They allow **operator overloading** and enable Pythonic behaviors for custom classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Important Notes:\n",
    "- You do not normally call these methods directly (e.g., obj.\\_\\_init\\_\\_()); Python calls them internally on specific actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **\\_\\_init\\_\\_ —** called automatically when you create (instantiate) a new object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **\\_\\_len\\_\\_ —** called when you use the built-in len() function on an object.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **\\_\\_str\\_\\_ and \\_\\_repr\\_\\_ —** control how an object is represented as a string.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **\\_\\_call\\_\\_ —** allows an object to be called like a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - **\\_\\_add\\_\\_, \\_\\_mul\\_\\_ —** used for operator overloading (e.g., +, * operators)."

    "- Implementing \\_\\_str\\_\\_ makes printed output more user-friendly, whereas \\_\\_repr\\_\\_ is for developers.\n",
