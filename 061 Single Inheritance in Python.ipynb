    "#  Introduction to Single Inheritance\n",
    "- Inheritance is a fundamental feature in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that allows a class to inherit attributes and behaviors (methods) from another class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Single Inheritance is the simplest and most common form of inheritance.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In Single Inheritance, there are two classes involved:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Parent Class (Base Class): The class that is being inherited from.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Child Class (Derived Class): The class that inherits from the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This means a child class inherits all properties (data members) and methods (functions) from one parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key definition:\n",
    "Single inheritance is a type of inheritance where a class inherits properties and behaviors from a single parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Use Single Inheritance?\n",
    "- Promotes code reusability by allowing child classes to use and extend code already written in the parent class.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Makes the code more organized and easier to maintain.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps avoid redundancy by sharing common functionality between classes.\n",
