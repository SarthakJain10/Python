    "# Introduction\n",
    "- Time Module is a built-in Python module designed to perform various time-related operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- It allows Python programs to work with system time, measure execution time, delay program execution, format time, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python provides very accurate and precise time measurement capabilities, often more reliable than regular system watches in terms of programming needs.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Use Time Module?\n",
    "- Useful for measuring the performance or execution time of segments of code (e.g., comparing For loop vs While loop).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Helps manage delays or pauses in program execution (e.g., making the program wait for a few seconds).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Retrieves current system time which can be formatted and used in the program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Vital for scenarios where time-dependent tasks, benchmarks, or scheduling are needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Key Concepts and Functions in the Time Module\n",
    "### 1. time.time()\n",
    "- Returns the current time in seconds as a floating point number since the \"epoch.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Epoch:** The reference point for time, which is January 1st, 1970, 00:00:00 UTC.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example usage:"
