    "# 1. What is a Generator?\n",
    "- A generator is a type of function that instead of returning a single value, yields values one at a time as they are requested.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Unlike lists, generators do not store all the values in memory at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They keep the state (information needed to produce the next value) internally and generate each value dynamically when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Points:\n",
    "- Generators generate values on the fly (dynamically) rather than pre-storing them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are memory efficient because they do not hold all items at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The generator object itself stores the \"recipe\" or information to create the next value, not the value itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Analogy:\n",
    "Think of a generator as a mango seed rather than a full mango tree. The seed contains everything necessary to grow the tree but doesn’t take up the space the whole tree would.\n",
    "\n",
    "# 2. The yield Keyword\n",
    "- The yield keyword is used inside generator functions to produce a value and temporarily suspend the function’s execution, saving its state.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the generator’s next item is requested, the function resumes immediately after the last yield statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "- This allows values to be produced lazily and one at a time."
