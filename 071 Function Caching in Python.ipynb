    "# Introduction\n",
    "- **Topic:** Function Caching in Python\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Context:** Useful when the same function is repeatedly called with the same inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Goal:** To optimize expensive computational tasks by avoiding redundant calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Key technique introduced:** Memoization (a caching technique).\n",
    "\n",
    "# What is Function Caching?\n",
    "### Definition:\n",
    "Function caching is a technique to store the results of expensive function calls and return the cached result when the same inputs occur again.\n",
    "\n",
    "### When to use it:\n",
    "When a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Takes significant time (computationally expensive),\n",
    "\n",
    "- Is called multiple times,\n",
    "\n",
    "- With the same argument(s)/input(s).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example scenario:\n",
    "Suppose a function takes 10 seconds to run once. If this function is called 1000 times for repeated inputs, repeated execution without caching can be very time-consuming (e.g., 1000 calls ×10 seconds = 10,000 seconds). Function caching reduces this drastically."

    "# Important Concepts\n",
    "### 1. Expensive Function\n",
    "- Expensive means a function that takes considerable processing time or resources.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Heavy mathematical computations,\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Network requests,\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Data retrieval operations,\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Complex recursive calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Cache Storage\n",
    "- Cache stores the result for a specific input.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the function is called again with the same input, the program checks if the result exists in the cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If yes, it retrieves the result instantly from cache, skipping the actual computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If not, it computes the result and stores it in the cache for future use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Memoization\n",
    "- Memoization is the process of storing function output results the first time they are computed.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Subsequent calls with the same input return results from the cache.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Improves efficiency for functions with overlapping subproblems (like recursive functions: Fibonacci, dynamic programming problems).\n",
    "\n",

    "### Explanation through a Demonstration\n",
    "- The function sleeps for 5 seconds to simulate costly computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On first call with a specific input (expensive_function(20)), the function delays 5 seconds and computes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- On subsequent calls with the same input (expensive_function(20) again), the result is fetched instantly from cache without delay.\n",
    "\n",
    "- If a new input (e.g., expensive_function(61)) is used, the function again takes the delay to compute since it has no cached result for this input.\n",
