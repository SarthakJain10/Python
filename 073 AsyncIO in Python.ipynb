    "# Introduction to AsyncIO\n",
    "- AsyncIO is a Python library that enables writing asynchronous, concurrent code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Important clarification:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - AsyncIO is neither multithreading nor multiprocessing.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - It is a method to achieve concurrency without creating separate threads or processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Concurrency means managing multiple tasks seemingly simultaneously but not necessarily in parallel execution (like multithreading), instead using efficient switching.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Typical Python Execution Flow (Synchronous)\n",
    "\n",
    "- Example with three functions function1(), function2(), and function3():\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Each function blocks the execution, meaning the next function starts only after the current one completes.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Using time.sleep(seconds) inside a function simulates blocking operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Behavior example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    - function1() executes, prints after 3 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Then function2() executes, prints after 3 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Finally function3() runs after all the above, again taking 3 seconds.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Total time roughly = sum of individual wait times, which is inefficient."
