    "# Introduction to Multithreading\n",
    "- Multithreading enables concurrent execution of multiple tasks (threads) within a single program.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Use case:** Efficiently perform multiple operations, such as downloading multiple files from different servers in parallel instead of sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Benefits:**\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Saves time by performing I/O bound tasks concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Makes use of system resources (CPU, internet bandwidth) effectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "Suppose you want to download 10 large files (each 10 GB) from 10 different servers. Doing this sequentially wastes time whereas multithreading downloads files simultaneously.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Use Multithreading?\n",
    "\n",
    "- **I/O Bound Tasks:** Tasks involving waiting (e.g., file downloads, network calls, reading/writing files) benefit the most.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Parallel resource usage:** If you have multiple independent tasks, it's better to run them concurrently.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **CPU Speed and Internet Speed:** With fast hardware and internet, sequential operations limit throughput unnecessarily.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Efficient waiting:** While one thread waits for I/O, another thread can run, improving overall efficiency.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Python’s Default Execution Model\n",
    "- Python executes code sequentially by default.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Functions block execution while they run (e.g., sleeping or downloading).\n",
    "\n",
    "- This sequential behavior can result in wasted time when performing multiple independent I/O operations.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Multithreading reduces total execution time roughly to the longest individual task.\n",

    "- Performance gains occur primarily in I/O heavy tasks (e.g., downloading multiple files).\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python's concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor offers a simpler, high-level approach to managing thread pools and tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always consider the nature of your tasks (I/O bound vs CPU bound) before choosing multithreading. \n",
