    "# Introduction\n",
    "Multiprocessing in Python allows running multiple processes simultaneously, enabling real parallelism on multi-core CPUs. Unlike multithreading, which runs multiple threads within the same process and suffers from Python’s GIL (Global Interpreter Lock), multiprocessing involves completely independent processes that can run on separate CPU cores, improving performance for CPU-bound tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Why Multiprocessing?\n",
    "- Multithreading is lightweight and fast to spawn but limited by GIL in Python, which prevents true parallel execution of threads for CPU-intensive tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Multiprocessing overcomes GIL by creating separate processes with their own Python interpreter and memory space.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Efficient for heavy CPU-bound work or when you want true parallelism.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Can be used for I/O-bound tasks where parallel downloads or tasks run simultaneously.\n",
